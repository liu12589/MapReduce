MapReduce is a programming model and an associ-ated implementation for processing and generating largedata sets.  Users specify amapfunction that processes akey/value pair to generate a set of intermediate key/valuepairs, and areducefunction that merges all intermediatevalues associated with the same intermediate key. Manyreal world tasks are expressible in this model, as shownin the paper.Programs written in this functional style are automati-cally parallelized and executed on a large cluster of com-modity machines. The run-time system takes care of thedetails of partitioning the input data, scheduling the pro-gram’s execution across a set of machines, handling ma-chine failures, and managing the required inter-machinecommunication.  This allows programmers without anyexperience with parallel and distributed systems to eas-ily utilize the resources of a large distributed system.Our  implementation of  MapReduce runs  on  a  largecluster of commodity machines and is highly scalable:a typical MapReduce computation processes many ter-abytes of data on thousands of machines.  Programmersfind the system easy to use: hundreds of MapReduce pro-grams have been implemented and upwards of one thou-sand MapReduce jobs are executed on Google’s clustersevery day.
